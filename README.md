# Dawn
 
A compiler for the Eos language, a multi-paradigm programming language with a C style syntax. This project is in a very early stage of development and the design of the language is not anywhere near finalised.

- [x] The language is Turing complete (shown by implementing [Rule 110](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110), see [rule110.eos](./examples/rule110.eos))

## Future plans
Things I want to implement in the future:
- [ ] Algebraic types with possibility of recursive types
- [ ] Pattern matching
- [ ] Higher-order functions 
- [ ] Rust style traits

and more to be seen...
